	- Started with Project
		- Project Init - backend and frontend
		- cd backend
		- pnpm init or npm init -y
		- create src/index.js
		- install nodemon globally - using -g tag
		- prisma install
		- prisma client install
		- prisma init
		- docker run
			- docker run --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
		- Here db - DATABASE_URL="postgresql://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/postgres"
		- create lib/db.js (empty file)
		- Edit schema.prisma file
			- create User and UserRole schema
		- npx prisma generate (generate file ) or pnpm dlx prisma generate
		- db.js - import prismaclient file that generated with cli
		- best practice - suggested by prisma - Singleton Pattern
		- npx prisma migrate dev (it will push db to create table)
		- npx prisma db push (sync our db)
		- auth.route
			- register post route
			- login
			- logout
			- check
		- auth controller in controller folder
			- install bcrypt for encryption
			- register
				- try catch
				- existingUser find by email
				- if not existed
				- hashed Password with salt
				- save hashedpassword in db along with email and password and enum user role 
					- By default user
				- jwt token for easy login and logout without going every trip to auth
				- cookie parser
				- jwt sign by id + JWT Secret in env
					- Expires In
				- open bash shell - to generate string
					- openssl rand -hex 32
					- copy and paste in JWT secret
				- Go to index file
					- add cookie parser 
					- use as middleware
				- save res cookie with jwt
					- httpsonly
					- samesite
					- secure - not development server
					- maxage - in miliseconds
						- 7 days = 1000 x 60 x 60 x 24 x 7
				- User is created and send response
					- with 201 json message
					- user
						- id
						- email
						- name
						- role
						- Not password
						- image 
				- catch field
					- catch error with json response
				- Test with postman
			- login
				- req body with email password
				- try catch 
				- try
					- const user = db.user.findUnique
						- where email
					- if no user - send response 401 with json message
						- user not found
					- if user found
						- password match with our hashed password with bcrypt
					- if not match send response
						- 401 with message - nhe mila password
						- why invalid credentials
							- We did not want hacker to know that password is not matching , 
					- sign jwt token with jwt secret from end file with expires in
				- catch
					- catch error
			- logout
				- trycatch
				- try
					- res. clear cookie ( jwt cookie name)
					- res.status with 204 json with message
				- catch
			- check
				- to check if the user is existed or not
				- try catch
				- try
					- res wtih status 200 and message - user auth success
					- authmiddleware 
					- go to auth route
					- logout required authmiddlewre
					- check - we send user
				- Setting middleware - creating a folder in src
					- create auth.middleware
						- jwt 
						- authMiddleware 
							- token from req cookies jwt
							- if not token
								- send res 401 with message unauthorised
							- if decoded
								- trycatch
								- jwt verify with token and jwt secre from env file
								- if not match - send error
							- find user from db with matched id
								- select user details
							- if user not found 
								- send 404 status with message - user not found
							- if user found
								- req attach with user
		- DB update
			- update prisma
				- Problem table
				- enum difficulty level
			- after every change in schema
				- npx prisma generate
				- npx prisma migrate
				- npx prisma push
